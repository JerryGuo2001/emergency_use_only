,,survey,204632,survey-questions,,,none,med,I was not doing anything else but it is very late here and I am a bit tired. One other thing - most of the time I had to click more than once to get the in between city to register (get a bold black border around it). I was able to do that eventually but it did add time to that section.,When I saw the instructions I was sure I would not remember any of the combinations; and I didn't. (I'm not sure the added color task made any difference.) At some point I just decided to go with my knowledge of where the places were; ie in which state/part of the country; and used that. It worked for most of the locations except for a couple I didn't know of (the only Cornwall I know of is an area in the UK; and there are hot springs all over the west so I decided the one here was near Boulder).,If you mean in the early parts - no; they were all impossible. Even though I know where most of those places are generally; there were too many combinations. There were so many in fact that I thought you'd covered every combination there could be.,I've been doing studies for a lot of years and I think I'd remember if I did anything like this; so I'm sure I haven't. My MTurk ID is A1PLKT0OSX7AHC if you want to check but I haven't worked there in at least a couple of years.,This was *very* long and here in PA it didn't show up until after 9:30 pm; which is late. I think you are in CA; you might want to consider time zones when you post anything; especially if it's as long as this was. Also - I did actually visit the bathroom after either the first or second page; you may see that if you're looking at times. I wouldn't be surprised if other people did the same thing at some point.

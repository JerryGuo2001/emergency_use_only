,,survey,160133,survey-questions,,,none,high,No; I was not doing anything else during this study.,When looking at the paired objects; sometimes I tried to do more than just make a story between them.  For instance; if they shared the same first letter; then I tried to remember them paired in that way.  ,I felt that if certain objects shared the same first letter; then they were a little easier to learn/remember as pairs.  ,No; I have not participated in a similar study to this before.,I did feel that it was a little hard for me to do the color attention task at the same time as the pair memory task.  I think part of the reason for this is that numbers 1 and 2 on the keyboard are right next to each other; so you're forced to use one hand to press them; instead of separate hands across the keyboard.  As a result; it's easier to make a mistake in hitting #1; when you meant to hit #2 instead; and vice versa.  I think that maybe it might be better or more helpful if participants use letters or numbers that are further apart on the keyboard; when doing the color attention/identification part; in order to minimize the possibility of finger reflexes hitting the wrong key too easily - especially since you're forced to use one hand to hit either numbers 1 or 2.
